This project is a videogame I made for my "Intro to Computer Science" class at Biola University in Fall 2022. The game involves strategically navigating a series of mazes while 
avoiding the spreading monsters within. My project works by reading data from files to generate the mazes and using a graphics library to display intuitive visuals of the mazes.
Every time the player (red) moves once, the monsters (black) get to move five times, placing a greater emphasis on the moves the player chooses to get to the goal (yellow). This game has seven
levels with unique strategies and scenarios.
